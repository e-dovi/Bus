# Real Time Bus Tracking
This project simulates a bus tracking system by allowing the user to see the different locations of a bus that runs between MIT and Harvard on the map. In this project we use the coordinates (longitude, latitude) of the stops and when the user clicks the **Show stops between MIT and Harvard** button, the map displays each of the stops successively.

To run the project, the user needs to get an authentication key from mapbox api and give its value to the variable _mapboxgl.accessToken_.
The next step is to open the _index.html_ file in a web browser.

A future improvement to this project is to use an api that provides the live location of the bus.
